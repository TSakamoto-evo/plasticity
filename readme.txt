1. Folder "simulation_main"
C++ scripts for simulations of Wright-Fisher model that was used to generate results in the main text and Table S1 are provided.
Free recombination is assumed.

2. Folder "simulation_linkage2"
C++ scripts for simulations of Wright-Fisher model that was used to generate Table S2 are provided.
Only the evolution of cis-regulatory is considered, and all cis-regulatory regions on a certain gene are assumed to be completely linked.
